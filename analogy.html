            <h3>The Scenario</h3>
            <p><em>"You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an iPhone 16 Pro Max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio."</em></p>

          <h3>Would I agree? The "Vibe Coder" Reflection</h3>
          <p><strong>The Answer:</strong> While the <em>tool</em> (iPhone/AI) is capable, the price (40k/High Salary) usually commands deeper technical expertise (Professional Gear/Deep Coding Knowledge). I would likely <strong>Think about</strong> the full premium price.</p>
          
          <h4>Justification & Integrity</h4>
          <p>This scenario perfectly mirrors the rise of <strong>"Vibe Coders"</strong>—developers who rely entirely on AI generators (the iPhone/CapCut) without understanding the underlying logic (Exposure/Color Grading/Code Architecture).<br><br>
          People might assume that videographers, photographers, and video editors should use slr cameras and high end application such as premeire pro and davinci resolve,but using these things would just over complicate the output and make it uglier.
        Using simple gear like an iphone and capcut would help the output especially if they have 2 years of experience.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Integrity of Work:</strong> An iPhone video looks great until the lighting conditions become difficult. Similarly, an AI coder produces great code until a complex bug arises. True integrity comes from knowing why it works, not just that it looks good, but it really depends on the prompt of the vibe coder and how he understands his/her code therefore it really lies on what is the technique of a coder.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Level:</strong> A professional photographer knows how to handle a corrupted SD card or bad lighting. A professional developer knows how to debug a race condition that AI can't see, but remember an iphone can also know how to adjust with bad lighting making the output more pleasing like a good vibe coder he/she just really needs to understand what they are doing for them to be actually good.</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Templates (CapCut/Copilot) kill originality. True value lies in custom problem solving, some vibe coders are really guilty about this, just prompting one general prompt and it is okay, but smart and good vibe coders would adjust and pour their idea into the prompt.</li>
