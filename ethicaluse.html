          <h3>In Academe</h3>
          <p class="muted">AI should be used as a tool to support learning, not replace genuine student work. Students should use AI responsibly for it can enhance their understanding while still producing original content and showin their own skills.

          <h3>Avoiding plagiarism and misuse
</h3>
          <p class="muted">The use of AI in generating text must not be submitted as personal work without proper acknowledgement. Using AI to do homework or school work damages academic integrity. All students should always remember to cite any contribution made by AI on their assignments to ensure that they did their work accurately and did their own thinking.

          <h3>Accuracy and verification of AI outputs
</h3>
          <p class="muted">AI can also be incorrect, outdated, and give us misleading information. With this, all students should check the sources, and confirm whether the content aligns with credible academic references.

          <h3>Bias and fairness
</h3>
          <p class="muted">Artificial Intelligence can also be biased or give unfair responses because they learn from data that may contain stereotypes or unequal representations. People who use AI dependently should be aware of this possibility and carefully evaluate AI-generated content before using it. Lastly, it is crucial to check the information whether it is fair, balanced, and respectful, to avoid relying on outputs that give harmful assumptions or discrimination.
