            <h3>What is Generative AI?</h3>
            <p>Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence designed to create new content such as text, images, music or even code by learning patterns from existing data. This AI can generate original outputs that are often indistinguishable from human-created content. Also, these models use techniques such as deep learning and neural networks to generate output. </p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>Generative AI works by learning from large amounts of data, similar to how humans learn by noticing patterns. In terms of language processing, generative AI breaks text down into smaller, manageable units called tokens, which may be whole words, part of words, or single characters, depending on the model. This also allows the model to handle a diverse range of vocabulary and linguistic variations more effectively. In simple terms, generative AI absorbs information, recognizes patterns, and uses that information to produce human-like creations.

            <h3>What are its strengths?</h3>
            <p>The strengths of ai is that it can produce diverse outputs and personalize not just the output but the user experience, it gives a fair chance to those who want to compete and helps people to do their jobs better.</p>

            <h3>What are its limitations or risks?</h3>
            <p>It's all about leveling the playing field. AI allows people to work efficiently. It acts like a booster that makes people work harder, smarter, and more focused on their work. But people misuse AI by completely relying on it, no human idea just pure AI. Pure AI would just make your work sloppy, very general and not creative. </p>
